## Babashka & Web experiments

Here you can find a bunch of small webapps each of which is a standalone Babashka script.

### Contents

- [scittle-ticker.clj](./scittle-ticker.clj) - a "fullstack" app with [Babashka](https://babashka.org/) on the server and the [Scittle](https://babashka.org/scittle/) + [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com) on the client side. No JS needed to be build!
- [htmx-todo-app.clj](./htmx-todo-app.clj) - a simplified interactive TODO App built using [HTMX](https://htmx.org) and also PicoCSS. Here no client-side code was written at all!
